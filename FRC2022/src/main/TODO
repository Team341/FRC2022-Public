Right now the automated climb has a button to wait for the operator to say continue, but what if the robot isn't in position and the operator has to manually adjust. How do we let them adjust?

Need to test the ball spitting logic is working on the new robot
Need to tune the shooter w/vision ranges
Confirm button mapping for robot functions is good with Drive Booth\Sean
Status LEDs for the hanger sequence
